# Words-App


Words app allows you to select a letter and use Intents to navigate to an Activity that presents a number of words starting with that letter. Each word can be looked up via a web search.

Words app contains a scrollable list of 26 letters A to Z in a RecyclerView. The orientation of the RecyclerView can be changed between a vertical list or a grid of items.

The app demonstrates the use of Intents in two ways:

* To navigate inside an app by specifying an explicit destination, and,
* Allowing Android to service the Intent using the apps and resources present on the device.
